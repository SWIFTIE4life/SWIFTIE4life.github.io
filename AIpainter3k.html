<p> I used gaugan AI painter to modify my simple drawings into two nature paintings.They are both with sea paintings with the sky as its ceiling.They are a bit unrealistic but kinda in a good way. </p>
<p>The first painting is supposed to be a sunset but got modified into a red stormover the ocean.</p>
