Her brother had gotten married recently and he was followed by his new wife and two kids.If this wasn't shocking enough news for Sarah the wife that her brother recenntly married to was none other than the same woman her ex cheated her for.

Needless to say, the reunion wasn't going well and soon it was time for them to go their separate ways.
